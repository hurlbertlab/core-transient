#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
# ---- EXPLORE AND FORMAT SPECIES DATA ----
#===============================================================================*
# Here, your primary goal is to ensure that all of your species are valid. To do so, you need to look at the list of unique species very carefully. Avoid being too liberal in interpretation, if you notice an entry that MIGHT be a problem, but you can't say with certainty, create an issue on GitHub.

# Look at the individual species present:

levels(dataset5$species) 

# Now explore the listed species themselves, again. A good trick here to finding problematic entries is to shrink the console below horizontally so that species names will appear in a single column.  This way you can more easily scan the species names (listed alphabetically) and identify potential misspellings, extra characters or blank space, or other issues.

levels(dataset5$species)

# If there are entries that only specify the genus while there are others that specify the species in addition to that same genus, they need to be regrouped in order to avoid ambiguity. For example, if there are entries of 'Cygnus', 'Cygnus_columbianus', and 'Cygnus_cygnus', 'Cygnus' could refer to either species, but the observer could not identify it. This causes ambiguity in the data, and must be fixed by either 1. deleting the genus-only entry altogether, or 2. renaming the genus-species entries to just the genus-only entry. 
# This decision can be fairly subjective, but generally if less than 25% of the entries are genus-only, then they can be deleted (using bad_sp). If more than 25% of the entries for that genus are only specified to the genus, then the genus-species entries should be renamed to be genus-only (using typo_name). 

table(dataset5$species)

# If species names are coded (not scientific names) go back to study's metadata to learn what species should and shouldn't be in the data. 

# In this example, a quick look at the metadata is not informative, unfortunately. Because of this, you should really stop here and post an issue on GitHub. With some more thorough digging, however, I've found the names represent "Kartez codes". Several species can be removed (double-checked with USDA plant codes at plants.usda.gov and another Sevilleta study (dataset 254) that provides species names for some codes). Some codes were identified with this pdf from White Sands: https://nhnm.unm.edu/sites/default/files/nonsensitive/publications/nhnm/U00MUL02NMUS.pdf
